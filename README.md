# What is Git and GitHub?

Git is a version controlling tool used to manage changes in code. it keeps a record of what changes were made when they were made and who made the changes. using git a developer can go back to an older version of the project if something goes wrong. git works on the developers own system.

GitHub is a website that stores Git projects online. It allows developers to upload their Git repositories so they can be accessed from anywhere and can be shared with others. it allows for collborations with others

# Why they are used?
Git and Github are used mainly used for recover code and safetly revert changes if something goes wrong. we can make checkpoints for codes which we can go back to at any time
